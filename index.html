                <h1> Beach Party (Australia)</h1>
                <p>In the Southern Hemisphere, the “winter” holidays fall during the summer. Australian temperatures can get as warm as 84 degrees Fahrenheit around Christmas.
                    So naturally, many Australians head to the beach. Families and friends partake in swimming, picnics and volleyball. Often, some surfing Santas will make an
                    appearance. A couple of Sydney beaches are known to be a hotspot for foreign travelers and backpackers. In recent years the wild parties thrown there have
                    gotten so out of hand that alcohol bans have been implemented.</p>

                    <h1> Roller Skating to Mass (Venezuela)</h1>
                    <p> While Australians are surfing, Venezuelans are skating. It’s a long-running holiday tradition for the entire capital city of Caracas to roller skate
                        to early morning mass on Christmas Day. In fact, vehicles are banned from many parts of the city before 8 a.m. In case this form of transportation
                        isn’t strange enough, the night before kids will tie one end of a string to their big toe and hang the other end out of their bedroom window,
                        so passing roller skaters can give the string a friendly tug on their way to mass the next morning..</p>

                        <h1> KFC for Christmas (Japan)</h1>
                        <p>In the United States, we associate Christmas with ham or figgy pudding, but in Japan, it’s all about Kentucky Fried Chicken.
                            An estimated 3.5 million Japanese families eat fried chicken on Christmas Eve thanks to a marketing stunt by KFC in the 1970s
                            called Kurisumasu ni wa Kentakkii (“Kentucky for Christmas”). Christians make up a very small percentage of the Japanese population,
                            so this campaign made up for a lack of Christmas holiday traditions. The KFC Christmas Meal is so popular, many customers pre-order
                            their dinners — which include fried chicken, cake and champagne — months in advance.</p>
