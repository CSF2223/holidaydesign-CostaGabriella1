            Beach Party (Australia)
        </h1>
        <p>
            In the Southern Hemisphere, the “winter” holidays fall during the summer. Australian temperatures can get as warm as 84 degrees Fahrenheit around Christmas.
            So naturally, many Australians head to the beach. Families and friends partake in swimming, picnics and volleyball. Often, some surfing Santas will make an
            appearance. A couple of Sydney beaches are known to be a hotspot for foreign travelers and backpackers. In recent years the wild parties thrown there have
            gotten so out of hand that alcohol bans have been implemented.

            Roller Skating to Mass (Venezuela)
            </h1>
            <p>
               While Australians are surfing, Venezuelans are skating. It’s a long-running holiday tradition for the entire capital city of Caracas to roller skate
to early morning mass on Christmas Day. In fact, vehicles are banned from many parts of the city before 8 a.m. In case this form of transportation
isn’t strange enough, the night before kids will tie one end of a string to their big toe and hang the other end out of their bedroom window,
so passing roller skaters can give the string a friendly tug on their way to mass the next morning.
